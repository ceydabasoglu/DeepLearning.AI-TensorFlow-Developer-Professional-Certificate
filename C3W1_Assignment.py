# # Week 1: Explore the BBC News archive
# 
# Welcome! In this assignment you will be working with a variation of the [BBC News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc/overview), which contains 2225 examples of news articles with their respective categories (labels).
# 
# Let's get started!

# IMPORTANT: This will check your notebook's metadata for grading.
# Please do not continue the lab unless the output of this cell tells you to proceed.

# _**NOTE:** To prevent errors from the autograder, you are not allowed to edit or delete non-graded cells in this notebook . Please only put your solutions in between the `### START CODE HERE` and `### END CODE HERE` code comments, and also refrain from adding any new cells. **Once you have passed this assignment** and want to experiment with any of the non-graded code, you may follow the instructions at the bottom of this notebook._

import csv
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences


# Begin by looking at the structure of the csv that contains the data:

# grader-required-cell

with open("./data/bbc-text.csv", 'r') as csvfile:
    print(f"First line (header) looks like this:\n\n{csvfile.readline()}")
    print(f"Each data point looks like this:\n\n{csvfile.readline()}")     


# As you can see, each data point is composed of the category of the news article followed by a comma and then the actual text of the article.

# ## Removing Stopwords
# 
# One important step when working with text data is to remove the **stopwords** from it. These are the most common words in the language and they rarely provide useful information for the classification process.
# 
# Complete the `remove_stopwords` below. This function should receive a string and return another string that excludes all of the stopwords provided. You only need to account for whitespace as the separation mechanism between words in the sentence.

# grader-required-cell

# GRADED FUNCTION: remove_stopwords
def remove_stopwords(sentence):
    """
    Removes a list of stopwords
    
    Args:
        sentence (string): sentence to remove the stopwords from
    
    Returns:
        sentence (string): lowercase sentence without the stopwords

    # List of stopwords
    stopwords = ["a", "about", "above", "after", "again", "against", "all", "am", "an", "and", "any", "are", "as", "at", "be", "because", "been", "before", "being", "below", "between", "both", "but", "by", "could", "did", "do", "does", "doing", "down", "during", "each", "few", "for", "from", "further", "had", "has", "have", "having", "he", "he'd", "he'll", "he's", "her", "here", "here's", "hers", "herself", "him", "himself", "his", "how", "how's", "i", "i'd", "i'll", "i'm", "i've", "if", "in", "into", "is", "it", "it's", "its", "itself", "let's", "me", "more", "most", "my", "myself", "nor", "of", "on", "once", "only", "or", "other", "ought", "our", "ours", "ourselves", "out", "over", "own", "same", "she", "she'd", "she'll", "she's", "should", "so", "some", "such", "than", "that", "that's", "the", "their", "theirs", "them", "themselves", "then", "there", "there's", "these", "they", "they'd", "they'll", "they're", "they've", "this", "those", "through", "to", "too", "under", "until", "up", "very", "was", "we", "we'd", "we'll", "we're", "we've", "were", "what", "what's", "when", "when's", "where", "where's", "which", "while", "who", "who's", "whom", "why", "why's", "with", "would", "you", "you'd", "you'll", "you're", "you've", "your", "yours", "yourself", "yourselves" ]

    sentence = sentence.lower()

    words = sentence.split()

# Test your function
remove_stopwords("I am about to go to the store and get any snack")


# ***Expected Output:***
# ```
# 'go store get snack'
# 
# ```

# ## Reading the raw data
# 
# Now you need to read the data from the csv file. To do so, complete the `parse_data_from_file` function.
# 
# A couple of things to note:
# - You should omit the first line as it contains the headers and not data points.
# - There is no need to save the data points as numpy arrays, regular lists is fine.
# - To read from csv files use [`csv.reader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader) by passing the appropriate arguments.
# - `csv.reader` returns an iterable that returns each row in every iteration. So the label can be accessed via row[0] and the text via row[1].
# - Use the `remove_stopwords` function in each sentence.
